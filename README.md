The dataset is from kaggle which has quite interesting attributes including haemoglobin level, chest pain, resting electrocardiographic results etc. Some of which are categorical. Initial analysis was done to know more about the data such as the data types, if there are any null values and if the data is balanced or not. Two algorithms were used to train the model such as the Random Forest and Decision tree. The accuracies were also checked.
